Create a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python, where two players can go head-to-head in a battle of wits.
This console-based project allows players to take turns marking the game board with 'X' and 'O' until one player achieves victory by getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The game provides a user-friendly interface, validates moves to prevent cheating, and declares the winner or a draw when the game concludes. 
It was a fun and educational project that offers a great opportunity to practice Python programming skills while enjoying a timeless game.
